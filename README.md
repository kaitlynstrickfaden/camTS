A Shiny app for visualizing image data as a time series.

This app allows the user to generate time series plots with the dependent variable(s) of his/her choice. Then, the user can click on data points within the time series plot to view the image associated with that data point.

To use this Shiny app, place a CSV of data and the associated images in a folder(s) and then place that parent folder(s) in the "www" folder. If you have more than 1 CSV in the folder, you will probably break the app. If you place files other than images in the folder, you will probably also break the app. Future development will hopefully make the app less breakable. Stay tuned!
