# camTS
A Shiny app for visualizing image data as a time series.

This app allows the user to generate time series plots with the dependent variable(s) of his/her choice. Then, the user can click on data points within the time series plot to view the image associated with that data point.

To use this Shiny app, navigate to a parent folder containing folders of data for each site. Each site folder should contain a CSV and associated image data. If you have more than one CSV in the folder, you will probably break the app, so don't do that. See the other functions in the camTS package for prepping your data to feed into the app.
